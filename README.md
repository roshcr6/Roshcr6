I am passionate about designing and developing **scalable software systems** and exploring how **AI and Deep Learning** can solve real-world problems. I also enjoy experimenting with **game development**, where I blend psychology, storytelling, and mechanics to create engaging user experiences.  

I believe in continuous learning and enjoy working on projects that challenge me to grow as a developer. My current journey is focused on mastering **backend development, deep learning models, and cloud deployment practices**, while also nurturing my interest in **indie-style game design**.
